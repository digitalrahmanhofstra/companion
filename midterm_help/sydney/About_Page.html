  	<h2>Kai Photoproductions Quotes of motivation <h2>

<p>
"When words become unclear, I shall focus with photographs. When images become inadequate, I shall be content with silence."
"Photography is a way of feeling, of touching, of loving. What you have caught on film is captured forever… It remembers little things, long after you have forgotten everything."
"It’s one thing to make a picture of what a person looks like, it’s another thing to make a portrait of who they are."
"The best thing about a picture is that it never changes, even when the people in it do."

 The word "photography" was created from the Greek roots φωτός (phōtós), genitive of φῶς (phōs), "light"[2] and γραφή (graphé) "representation by means of lines" or "drawing",[3] together meaning "drawing with light".
